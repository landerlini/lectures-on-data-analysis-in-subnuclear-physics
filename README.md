# Lectures on data analysis in subnuclear physics
As lecturer at the University of Florence, I prepared a few notebooks to drive my students through their first steps in the field of Data Science, with particular attention to the techniques and the technologies that I believe they will find most useful in their careers as physicists or *STEM-people dealing with data*.

The course has always been severley time-constrained for an audience of young physicists that have barely seen some Python and sometimes only some C and the ambition of the course directors of including some *Machine Learning*.
The course ended up into a quick run through **Python** and **numpy** as foundational blocks for building statistical applications. A small fraction of the course is devoted to Monte Carlo methods, widely used in Subnuclear Physics for simulating particle interactions and stochastic effects in their detection and reconstruction. 
The second part of the course discusses important statistical applications, that students are already familiar with from their background, but rephrased using tensor algebra to be immediately transposed into `numpy` code. The applications considered are the *linear regression* and its *least-squared method* approximation and the *logistic regression*. 
While discussing the *logistic regression*, examples of numerical optimization using Minuit are provided.
Finally, we build on top of the *linear* and *logistic* regression to define advanced *regression* and *classification* methods based on *Polynomial expansions, *Decision Trees* and *Boosted Decision Trees*.
